This is the home of an openFrameworks 9.3-based vj system initially developed with a grant from 4Culture, an arts organization in King County as part of the Encephalophone Ensemble which performed at 9e2 Seattle in 2016.

It is architected to have extensible input options.  It currently has hooks for microphone-based audio input, OSC, and MIDI input.  It currently supports the AKAI MPD26; there is also an old branch with support for the LPD8.

It also leverages openFrameworks for 3D geometry and shaders.
